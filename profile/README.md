# Elegy Engine

Greek *elegos*, "song of mourning".

Elegy Engine is an umbrella project that encompasses the following:
* A game engine specialised for the development of retro FPS games and the like.
  * Think Quake, Half-Life, Unreal, Thief, System Shock.
  * Written in C#, targeting .NET 6 (soon 7), running on Windows and Linux at least.
  * MIT-licenced, free for everyone, for any purpose, forever.
* Tools to aid the above:
  * Map compiler (TBA)
  * Model importer (TBA)
  * Project wizard (TBA)
  * External developer console (TBA)

What Elegy is **not**:
* A Unity/Unreal/Godot clone.
  * This isn't your typical modern-day game engine. There is no integrated engine editor. Work is done in external tools, and when it comes to project management, it's just you and the filesystem.
  * The workflow will feel right at home if you've modded Quake or Half-Life.
* Meant for all genres, or even 2D.
  * Elegy aims to be usable for interactive first-person games. Whether it's a full-blown immersive sim shooter, or a walking simulator, that is the constraint.
  * This engine is essentially a specialisation of Godot, in a way. So, if you would like to make games of other genres (e.g. racing, puzzle, turn-based strategy), definitely consider using Godot itself.

*Note: early under construction, check us out again in Q3 2023.*
