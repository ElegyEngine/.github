# Elegy Engine

Greek *elegeia*, "poem of mourning".

Elegy Engine is an umbrella project that encompasses the following:
* A game engine specialised for retro FPS games and the like.
  * Think Quake, Half-Life, Unreal, Thief, System Shock.
  * Written in C#, targeting .NET 8, running on Windows and Linux at least.
  * Uses Vulkan for rendering.
  * MIT-licenced, free for everyone, for any purpose, forever.
* Tools to aid the above:
  * [Map compiler](https://github.com/ElegyEngine/ElegyEngine/tree/master/src/Elegy.MapCompiler)
  * [External developer console](https://github.com/ElegyEngine/ElegyDevConsoleApp)
  * Project wizard (TBA)
  * Model importer (TBA)

What Elegy is **not**:
* A Unity/Unreal clone, or competing with any other engine.
  * This isn't your typical modern-day game engine. There is no integrated engine editor. Work is done in external tools, and when it comes to project management, it's just you and the filesystem.
  * The workflow will feel right at home if you've modded Quake or Half-Life.
  * It's not designed for big teams/AAA studios. Rather it's meant for solo devs and tiny teams.
* Meant for all genres, or even 2D.
  * Elegy aims to be usable for interactive first-person games. Whether it's a full-blown immersive sim shooter, or a walking simulator, that is the constraint.
  * Up until February 2024, this engine was a specialisation of Godot. So, if you would like to make games of other genres (racing, puzzle, turn-based strategy) or dimensions than 3D, definitely consider using Godot itself.

*Note: early under construction, check us out again in Q3 2024.*
